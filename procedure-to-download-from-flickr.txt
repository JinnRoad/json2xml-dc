1.	Request flickr to prepare files for download. Flickr may take a few DAYS to finish. Mike Hearn can show you how this is done.

2.	On the Settings page, scroll down until you see "Your Flickr Data". There will be two sections of files:
	1.	Account Data (which is the metadata)
	2.	Photos and Videos

3.	Make a list of all the links for these files:
	1.	Copy the first link in Account Data, which will look something like this:

		https://s3.amazonaws.com/flickr-metadump-us-east-1/72157720971061034_0a06d767fc16_part1.zip

		Notice the last part of that file is "part1".
		Use some tool (vim, bash, etc) to quickly make a list of files like:

		https://s3.amazonaws.com/flickr-metadump-us-east-1/72157720971061034_0a06d767fc16_part2.zip
		.
		.
		.
		https://s3.amazonaws.com/flickr-metadump-us-east-1/72157720971061034_0a06d767fc16_part10.zip

	2.	Repeat the same process for the links in the Photos and Videos section:
