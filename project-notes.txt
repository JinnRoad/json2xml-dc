# TODO
- research what to do with geo data then consult rachel
- begin conversion process with sample JSON
- once that works, make COPIES of real data and use that

# INFO
- rachel orliago is determining what we need to move to dublin core
- keep groups: keep the information
- keep json:date_taken

# QUESTIONS
- WAIT: rachel will find better dc fields for tag in tags
- which dc:field does the json:groups field go into?
- does preservica pull in the EXIF date meta from the modern image files?

# First, look at json file and specify field conversions
# Second, look at XML file and specify the other neccessary fields
